module.exports = `Currently looking for Front-End Developer Opportunities! \n
 Prior to joining the Fullstack program I worked as a lead analyst at a premier health and benefits outsourcing firm. While I enjoyed this work, especially the MS SQL aspects, my responsibilities often fell under the diagnostics and project management umbrella. Having grown up working on cars, naturally I was curious as to what was going on 'under the hood' of our software. This is what drove me to coding . I hope to find a job that combines the analytical skills and software I gained during my time as an analyst with the technologies that I have immersed myself in during my time at Fullstack.
Proficient in SQL, SQL Server, Javascript, Github, Express, React, Redux
Knowledgable in HTML5, CSS, Socket.io, Mocha, Chai, scikit-learn,`
